# Stock Trading Android App

This repository is a placeholder for Stock Trading App which I have developed as part of the graduate level course, CSCI 571 taken at USC (Spring 2022). The course instructor was Prof. Marco Papa.

Note: The actual repository, which contains the source code, has been made private so as to honour the code of conduct of the University. It will only be available to potential employers who want to assess my capabilities in similar domains (and also who will agree not to share it with anyone else too). If you want to look at the code, email me at: shamika@usc.edu
